            <p>
                I am deeply passionate about technology and its ability to transform lives. My journey into Computer Science has been driven by curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems through code. Besides my academic pursuits, I enjoy staying active through sports like running, which helps me stay focused and disciplined. I believe in continuous learning and constantly challenge myself to improve both my technical skills and personal growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to coding and sports, I have a keen interest in AI and machine learning, which I plan to explore further in my studies. I am also an advocate for open-source software and enjoy contributing to projects that have a positive impact on the community.
